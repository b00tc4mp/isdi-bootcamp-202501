# MyLookAI

## Intro

**MyLookAI** is a smart fashion web app that helps you decide what to wear for any occasion. First, you upload your clothes (shirts, pants, shoes, etc.), and then the app, using artificial intelligence, suggests personalized outfits based on the event, weather, or style you need.

Each user has a unique profile, a digital wardrobe, and can request suggestions.

Next version, users will also be able to upload photos of their clothes so the AI can understand them automatically.

## Functionalities

4. Request an outfit suggestion for a specific context:
   - Formal / Informal

   - Additional predefined details
   - Number of suggestions desired (1 to 3)
5. Receive outfit suggestions powered by AI
6. View and save suggested looks

## Technical Stack

### Architecture

- **Frontend**: React.js (Vite), TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Database**: MongoDB + Mongoose
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API (GPT-3.5 Turbo) — communicates **only** with the backend API (not directly with the client)

---

## Blocks

### App (Client Side Application)

- Developed in React.js with TailwindCSS.
- Contains folders:
  - `data`: data management for client
  - `logic`: frontend business logic (each logic file includes `.test.js` and `.spec.js` tests)
  - `public`: public static assets
  - `utils`: helper functions
  - `view`: visual components

### API (Server Side Application)

- Built in Node.js + Express.
- Handles AI communication: the OpenAI API is used exclusively within the server logic.
- Contains folders:
  - `data`: models, DB logic
  - `handlers`: middleware, response formatters
  - `logic`: backend business logic (each file includes `.test.js` and `.spec.js` tests)
  - `routes`: API endpoints
  - `test`: test scripts (`.sh` files)

### DB (Database)

- MongoDB with Mongoose.
- Contains all data schemas. IDs are generated automatically as `ObjectId`s.

### Packages (Project structure folders)

- `app`: React frontend
- `api`: Express backend
- `doc`: Common utilities and shared logic, such as:
  - `constants.js`
  - `errors.js`
  - `validate.js`
  - `index.js`

## Data Model (MVP)

### User

- \_id (ObjectId, auto-generated by MongoDB)
- name (string)
- email (string)
- password (string, hashed)
- createdAt (date)
- wardrobe ([ObjectId], references ClothingItem)

### ClothingItem

- \_id (ObjectId, auto-generated by MongoDB)
- owner (ObjectId, references User)
- category (string, enum: 'top', 'bottom', 'shoes', 'accessory') // Determines body section
- type (string) // e.g., "t-shirt", "jeans", "sneakers"
- color (string)
- season ([string], optional, enum: 'summer', 'winter', 'all-season') // Multiple allowed
- occasion ([string], optional, enum: 'formal', 'casual', 'sport', 'party') // Multiple allowed
- notes? (string)
- createdAt (date)

### LookRequest

- \_id (ObjectId, auto-generated by MongoDB)
- user (ObjectId, references User)
- contextOccasion (string, enum: 'formal', 'casual', 'party', 'sport')
- location (string, enum: 'indoor', 'outdoor')
- temperature (string, enum: 'cold', 'warm', 'neutral')
- timeOfDay? (string, enum: 'morning', 'afternoon', 'evening', 'night')
- style? (string, enum: 'classic', 'trendy', 'minimalist', 'colorful')
- additionalDetails? ([string]) // Max 3 tags chosen from a limited list (e.g. "date", "business", "rain")
- numberOfSuggestions (number, min: 1, max: 3)
- createdAt (date)

### LookSuggestion

- \_id (ObjectId, auto-generated by MongoDB)
- user (ObjectId, references User)
- request (ObjectId, references LookRequest)
- selectedItems ([ObjectId], references ClothingItem)
- reasoning (string) // Generated by the AI
- createdAt (date)

## AI & Validation Notes

- Users can only pick from predefined options in dropdowns, toggles, or multi-selects.
- Free-text fields are optional and limited (e.g., `notes`, `additionalDetails`) and validated.
- The AI **only** communicates with the **backend API**, never directly with the frontend.
- The backend ensures requests are well-structured before forwarding to the AI.
- To maintain output quality, invalid or incomplete fields are handled with defaults or request rejections.
- The AI's output returns a suggestion structured by:
  - Top (torso)
  - Bottom (waist down)
  - Shoes
  - Optional accessories (e.g. hat, belt, necklace)
